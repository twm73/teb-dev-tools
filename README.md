## Introduction [**↑**](#Table-of-Contents)
**A toolkit for easy creating CEP extensions for programs from the Adobe CC package.**  
If you are proficient in using scripts in Adobe CC programs, you will be able to create your own extension.
With this tool, you can design a fully functional palette with a graphical user interface.

![](Templates/Indd-PS-AI%20template/04%20documentation/template-documentation/images/tutorial-15.png)

You can utilize scripts from other creators to create a palette that suits your needs.
If you are already capable of writing your own scripts, this extension will allow them to take on a new quality.
Check out the tutorials to see how easy it is.
